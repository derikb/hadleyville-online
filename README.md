# Hadleyville Online

An web version of my rules light Old West RPG, [Hadleyville](https://madinkbeard.itch.io/hadleyville) (free at itch.io).

I have plans to add more features as time permits, see the todo file.

This is coded in Angular because I need to learn it for work.

This is also me working out the issues with my [RPG Table Randomizer library](https://github.com/derikb/rpg-table-randomizer).
